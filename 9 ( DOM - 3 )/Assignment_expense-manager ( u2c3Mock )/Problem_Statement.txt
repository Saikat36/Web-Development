Your app consists a form which contain 2 input tags and 1 select tag (this is already in template provided).

Form will take:- 

    month (select tag)
    income (input type of number)
    savings (input type of number)

On form submit all the values of the form should be appended in a div with an id of "reports" in small cards.

Each card should have following data with mentioned tags
    Month - h1 tag
    income - p tag
    expense - p tag
    In the cards, there should be another text within a h3 tag .

If income < expenses you should show "DEBT" in h3 tag and the color should be "red".
If income > expenses you should show "SAVE" in h3 tag and the color should be "green".
If income == expenses you should show "BREAKEVEN" in h3 tag and the color should be "orange.
Note : Make sure you use same tags in the cards
For better understanding you can refer to this image mock.png
In each card, there should be a delete button and on clicking, that button, that particular card should be deleted.
Make sure you follow all rules of forms.
